Sometimes
@In life,
@Difficult things will happen.
@Part of moving past these things

@This landscape is more than just a safe place for right now.
@It is a place that can be returned to any time.

@Each of these objects is more than just a piece of the landscape.
@They are tools.
@They are helpers and teachers and they will tell stories.
@Hopefully these stories inspire reflection and help in looking back on difficult things or events from the past,
@and can be helpful in moving past them.
